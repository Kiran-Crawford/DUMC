                <h3>Competitions</h3>
                <p>DUMC have an annual BUCS competition in mid-February. To compete in this event members are selected by the
                    bouldering captain. Our bouldering captain for 2018/19 is Dan Chadfield, aka Strong Dan (due to the ridiculous
                    amount of Dans in our club and the size of his biceps). Please note, if you are called Dan and wish to
                    join the club you will get a nickname because there really are too many of you. If you have any questions
                    about joining the team or Preseason you can email Strong Dan on the club email mountaineering.club@dur.ac.uk
                    . Throughout the year there are other friendly competitions that we encourage any member to take part
                    in. These took place once a month for October, November, December and February. In April we started a
                    friendly competition at the Valley in Newcastle, a fantastic event for all abilities with food provided
                    and freebies!
