                <h3>Competitions</h3>
                <p>DUMC have an annual BUCS competition in mid-February. To compete in this event members are selected by the
                    bouldering captain. Our bouldering captain for 2019/20 is Adrian Meahcer.  If you have any questions
                    about joining the team or Preseason you can email Adrian on the club email <a href="mailto:mountaineering.club@durham.ac.uk">mountaineering.club@durham.ac.uk</a>
                    . Throughout the year there are other friendly competitions that we encourage any member to take part
                    in. These took place once a month for October, November, December and February. In April we started a
                    friendly competition at the Valley in Newcastle, a fantastic event for all abilities with food provided
                    and freebies!
