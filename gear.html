        <h2>How to request Gear</h2>
        <p>The club owns lots of gear which you can borrow! If you would like to borrow anything, request it through the gear
            requst form. You must have paid membership to borrow club gear. Please request gear as far in advance as possible
            or you'll be much less likely to actually get the gear and more likely to annoy the gear sec! <br/>Please make sure
            you return everything in the same condition you got it in. If you do not return gear, or damage it
            beyond normal wear and tear, you may be liable for the cost of replacement. You may also be fined if you return
            it later than you've agreed with the gear sec and there is someone else waiting to borrow it.
        </p>
        <h5>
            <b> IMPORTANT- </b>It is your responsibilty to check gear is fit for use and you know how to use it. You use gear
            at your own risk. If you find any damage, or take any large falls on club gear, you
            <b>must</b> report it to the gear sec so it can be inspected and logged or retired.</h5>

        <h4>Seconding Gear</h4>
        <p>If you're a beginner, this is all the stuff you'll need to start with. When seconding, you belay the leader, then follow them up the climb, removing
            the gear they placed as you go up.
